# Part 0

In **Part 0** we set up the basic repository, including the initial `README` file, `.gitignore`, and `LICENSE` file.

First, the `LICENSE` file. This file describes the license of the project. For this project, I've chosen the MIT License.

The `.gitignore` file is generated from [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore), a site which allows you to enter a set of development tools and generates a set of standard ignore statements associated with those tools. We'll customize this later on with additional project-specific ignores.
